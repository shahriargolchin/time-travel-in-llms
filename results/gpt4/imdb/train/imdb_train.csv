"Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as ""Teachers"".

"Well, when before I saw this film I really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea...how wrong I was!

"There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. Zorro's Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First off, it's a Republic serial in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas but instead by workman-like actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here; as the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call upon. Another big difference is that the setting isn't California. The story here take place in central Mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop. Don't get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode, from corny ""twang"" bow sound effects to ludicrous acting. But overall, this represents one of the best Republic serials of all time, and probably the best Zorro one. The plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering., and there's lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits borrowed from this serial.",1 (Positive),"There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.

"Xizao, is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu), has died. He founds that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business, the public bathroom. The movie centers around Da Ming's family, and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job, something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon. Also, the movie explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls. The two main themes of the movie, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well handled, and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs. The director, Yang Zhang, tells his tale in a simple way, letting the characters characters do the job. It is a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly, and I highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good. Zhang has enormous potential, as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks. The acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed. The three lead characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely steals the show. Even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing ""old days were much better"" message, instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium, like saying that progress is good, and we must move on, but we must not forget where we came from, and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old.

"It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there. This is by far not one of the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst nonetheless. Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night Brings Charlie is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is way more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films. The film doesn't deliver on the on-screen deaths, there's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of on-screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film, just a bad one. The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements, done in a tongue in cheek way. For example, after a kill, Charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' sign and marks the population down one less. This is something that can only get a laugh. If you're into slasher films, definitely give this film a watch. It is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers, but not by much. The comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious. You may forget the movie, you may remember it.

But overall, it's just not a very good movie. It's not the worst slasher film out there, but it's certainly not one of the best either. It's just a mediocre, forgettable film that doesn't really stand out in any way. If you're a hardcore slasher fan, you might find some enjoyment in it, but for the average viewer, it's probably not worth your time.","The acting is mediocre at best, with the characters being one-dimensional and lacking any real depth. The plot is predictable and lacks any real suspense or tension, which is a crucial element in any slasher film. The dialogue is cheesy and often cringe-worthy, which only adds to the overall lack of quality. The film's attempt at humor falls flat, making it more of a chore to watch than an enjoyable experience. The special effects are also subpar, with the gore looking more like cheap Halloween decorations than anything else. The film's saving grace is its decent camera work and editing, but even that can't save it from being a bad movie. So, while it may not be the worst slasher film out there, it's certainly not a good one either.

I am not against showing reality but there is a way to show it. You don't have to show naked children to depict child abuse. There are other ways to show it. This movie is a total waste of time and money. I would not recommend it to anyone. It's a shame that such movies are being made and released. It's a big NO from my side.","I was appalled and disgusted by the blatant disregard for ethics and morality. The movie was a disgrace to the film industry and a slap in the face to the audience. The director, Madhur, should be ashamed of himself for creating such a repugnant piece of cinema. The actors involved should also be held accountable for their participation in such a vile project. The movie was not only offensive but also illegal, as it violated child protection laws. I strongly condemn this movie and urge everyone to boycott it. This is not art, this is a crime.",0.15,0.18,0.49,0.48,No,No,No
